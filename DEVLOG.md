resurrected td.  But it's written in python 2!

* convert to python 3 _done_


# BACKLOG

* Get it running (missing readline dependency?)
* Write a spec, bracket with tests
* Idea: it should use json or yml not picklefiles
* Colorama appears to be doing nothing

# Horizon scanning

* Can we integrate with workflowy's json in OneDrive
